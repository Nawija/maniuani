                                like readable English. Many desktop publishing
                                packages and web page editors now use Lorem
                                Ipsum as their default model text, and a search
                                for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites
                                still in their infancy. Various versions have
                                evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
                                sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
                                like).

                                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
                                simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                                classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
                                over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                                professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                                looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                                consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
                                going through the cites of the word in classical
                                literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
                                Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
                                1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
                                Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in
                                45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
                                ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
